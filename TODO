===============================================================================

For 1.0:

o All w4rn calls before readconfig are always turned off.  Fix this.

o Readconfig function (and maybe config format) needs to be redone.

o Make all optional code (openssl, openldap, etc) configured by autoconf.

o Fix GNOME so that Gconfd does not hang around after a user exits.
This is causing pam_mount's umount to fail on Red Hat 8.0 and Debian
unstable.

o Test mkehd a lot and recommend using it to simplify documentation.

o Use comments to document pre, post, and FNVAL conditions and insure they
are met (related to code scrub).

o Security audit.  Scrub code for buffer overflows and other
security-related bugs:
converse.c
pmhelper.c
readconfig.c

===============================================================================

Past 1.0 (punted):

o Get rid of FIXME and XXXs.

o Ensure that NFS shares are working.  Document NFS use.  Get TCFS working.

o Add the ability to create an encrypted loopback filesystem to useradd.
This should also create a README file in, for example, /home/mike that
explains setup.

o Modify passwd to update /home/mike.key.  Add -p, --post-script option
to run passwdehd?  (See passwdehd script)

o Get pam_mount in standard and Red Hat pam dist.

o Get supported by Red Hat.
	- Need upstream linux-utils/kernel to support encr.

o Make home directory images scalable in size (resize.*fs?).

o From Roman Sliva <roman.sliva@vsb.cz>: pam_mount doesn't mount ncp
filesystems of Novell servers using NDS - full context username must be
provided to ncpmount -U option (not just short unix name).  I solve this
by writing wrapper script for ncpmount, which gets full context username
using ldapsearch. I think a possibility of cooperation directly with
pam_ldap might be a great solution.

	- For NDS, use username to look up full context using LDAP?
		. email pam_ldap folks about sharing:
			1.  /etc/ldap.conf.
			2.  _get_user_info (gets userdn -- used by 
			    ldap_simple_bind).

= Personal ====================================================================

o Figure out better way to handle ~/.gnome/photo and move
/home/mike-nocrypt/.gnome back into ~.
