= For 1.0 =====================================================================

o Get in fedora (http://www.fedora.us/wiki/PackageSubmissionQAPolicy).

o Fix building deb in Makefile.am: make conditional?

o .spec must be re-generated for each version.

o ????? return to using user owned /var/run/pam_mount/test -- document
in code that this is a good idea to allow an option to ssh users besides
turning of priv. sep code.  Also, it renders the benefits of /etc/fstab
use.  BUT CAN SSH CREATE /var/run/ ENTRIES WHEN PRIV SEP ENABLED?

o fix detecting of previously mounted volumes that used --bind.

o test new "no --bind with remote mount" code.  (and ensure --bind is
used for local mounts)

o ensure I have enough loop devices for regression tests.

o Test/scrub glib code in optlist.c, etc.

o Should -N go in pam_mount.conf like it is now?  Shall I put this in
conf/pam_mount.conf?  How does hashing/not hashing affect scripts?

o why does fsck not run when login with gdm?

o ensure const's are used (see esp. hash argument to hash_authtok).

o replace PRE, POST and FN VAL conditions with asserts in code where applicable
	- Document fns with INPUT, SIDE AFFECTS and OUTPUT
	- assert that side affects if OUTPUT is not an error code
	- only one return statement per function so assertions may be made
	- mount.c
	- readconfig.c

o ensure NULL-termination is guarenteed everytime strlen is used.

o fix gconfd-2 blocking umount problem (gconfd-2).
		ALSO:
		bonobo-ac	/home/test (bonobo-activation-server)
		gnome-set	/home/test (gnome-settings-daemon)
		xscreensa	/home/test (xscreensaver -nosplash)
		mapping-d	/home/test (mapping-daemon)
		esd

o If losetup does not regain -k option, modify scripts.

o Scrub code one last time and allow people to test for a few weeks.

o Get rid of FIXMEs.

o Perhaps /var/run/pam_mount/* should be owned by root so users can not
edit it (see related FIXMEs)?  Currently testing.

= OpenBSD =====================================================================

o Add losetup/fsck code.

o Add support to vnconfig for reading passwords from stdin so that
it can be used for EHD on OBSD.

o Can't tell if EHD is already mounted on OpenBSD because mount says:
/dev/svnd0c on /home/mike/enc..., not /home/mike.img on /home/mike/enc.

o Make EHD on OpenBSD and Linux as similar as possible document EHD
on OpenBSD.

o Test new openpam to ensure OpenBSD patches are integrated.

= Past 1.0 (punted) ===========================================================

o Use format like smbmount /usr/bin/smbmount %(user) ... in pam_mount.conf
to simplify code in pmhelper.c.  This will make pam_mount much more
flexible too.  No smbmount, ncpmount, lclmount-specific code will
be required in smbmount.c.  Use libfmt_ptrn if on system, otherwise use
local copy (SEE CONFIGURE.IN and SRC/MAKEFILE.AM COMMENTS).  BUT FIRST
I NEED TO MAKE NEW USE GLIB.

o fork a (one, don't fork again if its already running) daemon that
continues to try and unmount volumes after a user logs out.  pam_mount
would pass the daemon volumes to unmount and cancel things if the user
logs back in.  HOW WOULD ALL OF THIS BE AUTHENTICATED?

o Break into multiple (root priveleged and user priv.) processes? 
	- See /* This code needs root priv. */
	- root "exec program" process (or user + "mount" POSIX capability? CAP_SYS_ADMIN (not very fine-grained)) use shared memory (see shmget) to pass argv to root process.
	- root "logger" process (or user + "logging" POSIX capability?)
	- root "update /var/run/pam_mount" process (or pseudouser/group that ownes /var/run/pam_mount?)
	- all else run with user privs.
  - OR -
	- reduce features
  - OR -
	- split into multiple pam modules, pam_fsck, etc.

o Get umount -l to release loop device when appropriate and possible?

o Ensure util-linux-2.11z-mountpoint.patch is in mail util-linux.

o Make pam_mount.c and mount.c completely binary passwd safe.

o Does auth code still work with null password?

o Debian-guy security flaw?  If changed, update luserconf info in
pam_mount.conf and pam_mount.xml.

o Why does pam_mount not work with RH 9.0's gdm?  Socket issue?
	I HAVE REPORTS THAT IT WORKS NOW.  DOES IT?

o Fix GNOME so that Gconfd does not hang around after a user exits.
This is causing pam_mount's umount to fail on Red Hat 8.0 and Debian
unstable.  In Red Hat bugzilla.

o Deamon to unmount volume after all processes finally exit after a user logs
out?  What if a user uses nohup?

o Change & config syntax to allow groups to be used.

o Remove pmhelper code completely from readconfig.c.

o Get smbmount and ncpmount to support mount-like -p0 option to simplify
pmhelper's code (Or ncpmount and mount to support PASSWD like smbmount).

o Fix Debian: see README_DEBIAN.

o Ensure that NFS shares are working.  Document NFS use.  Get TCFS
working.  Get SSLed NFS shares working.

o Add the ability to create an encrypted loopback filesystem to useradd.
This should also create a README file in, for example, /home/mike that
explains setup.  (useradd is a part of passwd package, adduser is a part
of adduser package).

o Modify passwd to update /home/mike.key.  Add -p, --post-script option
to run passwdehd?  (See passwdehd script)

o Get pam_mount in standard and Red Hat pam dist.

o Get supported by Red Hat.
	- Need upstream linux-utils/kernel to support encr.

o Make home directory images scalable in size (resize.*fs?).

o From Roman Sliva <roman.sliva@vsb.cz>: pam_mount doesn't mount ncp
filesystems of Novell servers using NDS - full context username must be
provided to ncpmount -U option (not just short unix name).  I solve this
by writing wrapper script for ncpmount, which gets full context username
using ldapsearch. I think a possibility of cooperation directly with
pam_ldap might be a great solution.

	- For NDS, use username to look up full context using LDAP?
		. email pam_ldap folks about sharing:
			1.  /etc/ldap.conf.
			2.  _get_user_info (gets userdn -- used by 
			    ldap_simple_bind).
	- SENT EMAIL TO PAM_LDAP MAINT. ABOUT EXPORTING LDAP INFO. USING
	PAM_SET_DATA.  WILL ALSO NEED TO IMPLEMNT A HACK TO ALLOW THIS
	INFO TO BE REFERENCED IN VOLUME DEFINITIONS UNTIL NICE, NEW
	VOLUME DEF. CODE IS IMPLEENTED.

o Write a nice GNOME control center applet to configre mounts.

o Tie in to xscreensaver?

= Personal ====================================================================

o Figure out better way to handle ~/.gnome/photo and move
/home/mike-nocrypt/.gnome back into ~.  Linux does not support union
mounting?
