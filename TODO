o Sync EHD article, README, and pam_mount.conf comments to ensure they
are all easily understandable.

o Should be able to mount NFS shares.

o On Debian, pam_mount complains: pam_mount: could not get password.
This is probably related to getting rid of "auth required pam_mount.so"
from /etc/pam.d/*.  I imagine there is a difference between RH and
Debian's PAM dist.  Or difference in /etc/pam.d?

o Security audit.

o Note: openssl 0.9.7 beta3 supports AES.

o Get rid of FIXMEs.

o Make first login create file system image?  Or make a script.  Or *add
to useradd*, or pam_mkhomedir.
	- Also create messages like in /home/mike-nocrypt/README and
	~mike/README (before crypt fs is mounted over ~mike).

	- Add -e, --encrypted-homedir option?

o Modify passwd to update /home/mike.key.
	- Add -p, --post-script option?

o Get pam_mount in standard and Red Hat pam dist.

o Get supported by Red Hat.
	- Need upstream linux-utils/kernel to support encr.

o Make home directory images scalable in size (resize.*fs?)

o Figure out better way to handle ~/.gnome/photo and move
/home/mike-nocrypt/.gnome back into ~.

One from Roman Sliva <roman.sliva@vsb.cz>

- Novell mounting
pam_mount doesn't mount ncp filesystems of Novell servers using NDS -
full context username must be provided to ncpmount -U option (not just
short unix name).  I solve this by writing wrapper script for ncpmount,
which gets full context username using ldapsearch. I think a possibility
of cooperation directly with pam_ldap might be a great solution.

From pam_patch/TODO:

allowing mount options -- bad idea: e.g. suid	
	allow/deny:
		currently using strcmp, but what about uid=XX type options?
		
have mode of not waiting for mount to finish
automatically include required options in allow
