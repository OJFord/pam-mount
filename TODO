= For 1.0 =====================================================================

o Does new smbmount code work?

o Does new ncpmount code work?

o Ensure mounting a volume as root does not prohibit user from changing
permissions on it.  Ensure users can unmount pam_mounted volumes
(or document).

o Fix GNOME so that Gconfd does not hang around after a user exits.
This is causing pam_mount's umount to fail on Red Hat 8.0 and Debian
unstable.  In Red Hat bugzilla.

o Evaluate fns related to options_allow, deny, and require (use splint?).

o Security audit.  Scrub code for buffer overflows and other
security-related bugs (use splint?):
pmhelper.c
pam_mount.c

= Past 1.0 (punted) ===========================================================

o Get smbmount and ncpmount to support mount-like -p0 option to simplify
pmhelper's code (Or ncpmount and mount to support PASSWD like smbmount).

o Fix Debian:
	Mounting encrypted loopback volumes with keybits option broken
		in unstable (bug 163639)
	CLOSE_SESSION set to no in /etc/login.defs (bug 163635)

o Get rid of FIXME and XXXs.

o Ensure that NFS shares are working.  Document NFS use.  Get TCFS working.

o Add the ability to create an encrypted loopback filesystem to useradd.
This should also create a README file in, for example, /home/mike that
explains setup.

o Modify passwd to update /home/mike.key.  Add -p, --post-script option
to run passwdehd?  (See passwdehd script)

o Get pam_mount in standard and Red Hat pam dist.

o Get supported by Red Hat.
	- Need upstream linux-utils/kernel to support encr.

o Make home directory images scalable in size (resize.*fs?).

o From Roman Sliva <roman.sliva@vsb.cz>: pam_mount doesn't mount ncp
filesystems of Novell servers using NDS - full context username must be
provided to ncpmount -U option (not just short unix name).  I solve this
by writing wrapper script for ncpmount, which gets full context username
using ldapsearch. I think a possibility of cooperation directly with
pam_ldap might be a great solution.

	- For NDS, use username to look up full context using LDAP?
		. email pam_ldap folks about sharing:
			1.  /etc/ldap.conf.
			2.  _get_user_info (gets userdn -- used by 
			    ldap_simple_bind).

= Personal ====================================================================

o Figure out better way to handle ~/.gnome/photo and move
/home/mike-nocrypt/.gnome back into ~.
