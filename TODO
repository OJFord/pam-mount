- Maybe the volume list of pam_mount could have templates. For example,

volume * smb krueger homes /home/*/krueger

would be a template for every user be able to mount its HOME directory
from the "krueger" samba server. 

Don't know if it is useful, provided that every user can have his/her
own ~/.pam_mount.conf file...

- To accompany templates, maybe the mount point could be created by
  pam_mount if it does not exist.
