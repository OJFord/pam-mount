= For 1.0 =====================================================================

o Inspect new use_first_pass-related code.  Test a lot with new test account.

o Document use with pam_ldap and pam_winbind (see /etc/pam.d/su).
Release new version on Freshmeat.

o Does try_first_pass work?

o Stop logging password in pam_mount.c and mount.c when done fixing LDAP!

o Move all mike's config to /etc/pam_mount.conf and use test account
for regression testing.  Add lot's of regression tests to test account.

o Test and check for security and readability: new fsck code and log_argv.

o Get winbind working!

o Automate debian/changelog because it determines the version of deb package.

o Debian-guy security flaw?  If changed, update luserconf info in
pam_mount.conf and pam_mount.xml.

o Why does pam_mount not work with RH 9.0's gdm?  Socket issue?
	I HAVE REPORTS THAT IT WORKS NOW.  DOES IT?

o Fix GNOME so that Gconfd does not hang around after a user exits.
This is causing pam_mount's umount to fail on Red Hat 8.0 and Debian
unstable.  In Red Hat bugzilla.

= OpenBSD =====================================================================

o Add losetup/fsck code.

o Add support to vnconfig for reading passwords from stdin so that
it can be used for EHD on OBSD.

o Can't tell if EHD is already mounted on OpenBSD because mount says:
/dev/svnd0c on /home/mike/enc..., not /home/mike.img on /home/mike/enc.

o Make EHD on OpenBSD and Linux as similar as possible document EHD
on OpenBSD.

o openpam su is broken.  memcpy causes "su mike" to try and execute
"mike".  Also, gives up root privelages before forking, resulting
in pam's close_session code being run with weak privelages. (submitted
patch)

= Past 1.0 (punted) ===========================================================

o Remove pmhelper code completely from readconfig.c.

o Use format like smbmount /usr/bin/smbmount %(user) ... in pam_mount.conf
to simplify code in pmhelper.c.  This will make pam_mount much more
flexible too.  No smbmount, ncpmount, lclmount-specific code will
be required in smbmount.c.  Use libnew if on system, otherwise use
local copy.

o Get smbmount and ncpmount to support mount-like -p0 option to simplify
pmhelper's code (Or ncpmount and mount to support PASSWD like smbmount).

o Fix Debian:
	Mounting encrypted loopback volumes with keybits option broken
		in unstable (bug 163639)
	CLOSE_SESSION set to no in /etc/login.defs (bug 163635)
	login drops root privileges before closing PAM session (bug ????)

o Get rid of FIXMEs.

o Ensure that NFS shares are working.  Document NFS use.  Get TCFS
working.  Get SSLed NFS shares working.

o Add the ability to create an encrypted loopback filesystem to useradd.
This should also create a README file in, for example, /home/mike that
explains setup.

o Modify passwd to update /home/mike.key.  Add -p, --post-script option
to run passwdehd?  (See passwdehd script)

o Get pam_mount in standard and Red Hat pam dist.

o Get supported by Red Hat.
	- Need upstream linux-utils/kernel to support encr.

o Make home directory images scalable in size (resize.*fs?).

o From Roman Sliva <roman.sliva@vsb.cz>: pam_mount doesn't mount ncp
filesystems of Novell servers using NDS - full context username must be
provided to ncpmount -U option (not just short unix name).  I solve this
by writing wrapper script for ncpmount, which gets full context username
using ldapsearch. I think a possibility of cooperation directly with
pam_ldap might be a great solution.

	- For NDS, use username to look up full context using LDAP?
		. email pam_ldap folks about sharing:
			1.  /etc/ldap.conf.
			2.  _get_user_info (gets userdn -- used by 
			    ldap_simple_bind).

= Personal ====================================================================

o Figure out better way to handle ~/.gnome/photo and move
/home/mike-nocrypt/.gnome back into ~.
