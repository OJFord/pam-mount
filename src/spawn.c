/*  spawn_apS

    Wrapper around that glib funky prototype spawn thing. Saves the old
    %SIGCHLD handler before installing our own (just %SIG_DFL actually).

    On success, returns 1 and the handler is NOT reset. Every [successful] call
    to spawn_apS() must be followed by spawn_restore_sigchld(). This is usually
    done after waitpid(), when we are sure there are no more pam_mount-created
    childs that could potentially confuse GDM.

    On failure, this function returns 0 and the original %SIGCHLD handler will
    be restored.

    All of this mess is required because GDM gets confused when the waitpid()
    from its %SIGCHLD handler sees a PID it did not spawn (note: pam_mount
    creates some). The workaround is to put GDM's %SIGCHLD handler back and
    set our own. Since pam_mount will explicitly wait for the exact PID it
    spawned, GDM childs are not touched. Afterwards, the handler is set back
    to its original value (see semantics above) so that GDM can handle its
    zombies.
