2000/11/15: Kjetil Torgrim Homme <kjetilho@ifi.uio.no> sent a patch to
            allow "template" or "wildcard" volumes. This bumped the version
            from 0.2 to 0.3.

2000/11/28: Kjetil Torgrim Homme <kjetilho@ifi.uio.no> sent another patch
	    so module waits for mount(8) to exit if the mount point happens
	    to be the user's $HOME

2001/12/17: Daniel Fairs <d.fairs@cogtest.com> tested a possible solution
	    for the no-wait-for-mount situation. There is another
	    seemingly French guy that actually pointed the problem and
	    suggested a solution, I need to find his name to print it here.

2002/06/27: Mukesh Agrawal <mukesh@agrawals.org> provided a patch to
            add support for loopback encrypted filesystems.  Mike Petullo
            <pam_mount@flyn.org> began to perform some maintenance on
            the code.
