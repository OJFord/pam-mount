o unit tests

o already_mounted() needs to handle /etc/mtab entries for dm-crypt volumes
mounted with patched util-linux.

o add printf and debug options that may be specified in pam.d.

o get test account working with patched mount and remove "crypt" type support.
	- see FIXME: ugly hack...
	- ensure "check for existing mount works with patched mount

o passwdehd needs work.

o make a test system that takes XML and creates  pam_mount.conf, images,
efsk's, mnt points and check script.

o finish .*_valid invariants.

o write class invariant function for assertions

o replace PRE, POST and FN VAL conditions with asserts in code where applicable
	- Document fns with INPUT, SIDE EFFECTS and OUTPUT
	- assert that side effects happen if OUTPUT is not an error code

o help test new mount/cryptsetup patch.
	- does not umount right
	- configure needs to -lselinux with -lcryptsetup

o how can I determine target user name when root su's to another user
or when I ssh using public key?

o need progress feedback from fsck, especially for gdm.

o regression tests:
	options = '-', do not use fstab
	options = '-', use fstab (mnt pt not defined either)

o Should -N go in pam_mount.conf like it is now?  Shall I put this in
conf/pam_mount.conf?  How does hashing/not hashing effect scripts?

o ensure '\0'-termination is guarenteed everytime strlen is used.

o If losetup does not regain -k option, modify scripts.

o Get rid of FIXMEs.

= OpenBSD =====================================================================

o Add losetup/fsck code.

o Add support to vnconfig for reading passwords from stdin so that
it can be used for EHD on OBSD.

o Can't tell if EHD is already mounted on OpenBSD because mount says:
/dev/svnd0c on /home/mike/enc..., not /home/mike.img on /home/mike/enc.

o Make EHD on OpenBSD and Linux as similar as possible document EHD
on OpenBSD.

o Test new openpam to ensure OpenBSD patches are integrated.

= Past 1.0 (punted) ===========================================================

o fork a (one, don't fork again if its already running) daemon that
continues to try and unmount volumes after a user logs out.  pam_mount
would pass the daemon volumes to unmount and cancel things if the user
logs back in.  HOW WOULD ALL OF THIS BE AUTHENTICATED?

o Break into multiple (root priveleged and user priv.) processes?
	- See /* This code needs root priv. */
	- root "exec program" process (or user + "mount" POSIX capability? CAP_SYS_ADMIN (not very fine-grained)) use shared memory (see shmget) to pass argv to root process.
	- root "logger" process (or user + "logging" POSIX capability?)
	- root "update /var/run/pam_mount" process (or pseudouser/group that ownes /var/run/pam_mount?)
	- all else run with user privs.
  - OR -
	- reduce features
  - OR -
	- split into multiple pam modules, pam_fsck, etc.

  => Third option preferably; AFAICS, there is already a pam_fsck.
     However, in case of loop/LVM mounts, pam_fsck might not know the device...

o Get umount -l to release loop device when appropriate and possible?

o Make pam_mount.c and mount.c completely binary passwd safe.

o Why does pam_mount not work with RH 9.0's gdm?  Socket issue?
	I HAVE REPORTS THAT IT WORKS NOW.  DOES IT?

o Fix GNOME so that Gconfd does not hang around after a user exits.
This is causing pam_mount's umount to fail on Red Hat 8.0 and Debian
unstable.  In Red Hat bugzilla.
    => not a pam_mount problem

o Deamon to unmount volume after all processes finally exit after a user logs
out?  What if a user uses nohup?
    => pam_mount is just not the thing to do non-interactive sessions. Period.

o Get smbmount and ncpmount to support mount-like -p0 option to simplify
pmhelper's code (Or ncpmount and mount to support PASSWD like smbmount).
    => CHECK IT NOW, it's almost working, if not entirely.

o Add the ability to create an encrypted loopback filesystem to useradd.
This should also create a README file in, for example, /home/mike that
explains setup.  (useradd is a part of passwd package, adduser is a part
of adduser package).
    => Not a pam_mount problem

o Modify passwd to update /home/mike.key.  Add -p, --post-script option
to run passwdehd?  (See passwdehd script)

o From Roman Sliva <roman.sliva@vsb.cz>: pam_mount doesn't mount ncp
filesystems of Novell servers using NDS - full context username must be
provided to ncpmount -U option (not just short unix name).  I solve this
by writing wrapper script for ncpmount, which gets full context username
using ldapsearch. I think a possibility of cooperation directly with
pam_ldap might be a great solution.

	- For NDS, use username to look up full context using LDAP?
		. email pam_ldap folks about sharing:
			1.  /etc/ldap.conf.
			2.  _get_user_info (gets userdn -- used by
			    ldap_simple_bind).
	- SENT EMAIL TO PAM_LDAP MAINT. ABOUT EXPORTING LDAP INFO. USING
	PAM_SET_DATA.  WILL ALSO NEED TO IMPLEMNT A HACK TO ALLOW THIS
	INFO TO BE REFERENCED IN VOLUME DEFINITIONS UNTIL NICE, NEW
	VOLUME DEF. CODE IS IMPLEENTED.
