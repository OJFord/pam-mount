Known Issues
============

[ davfs2 - password passing ]

The unmodified davfs mount program will not work with pam_mount because
it cannot be driven non-interactively. (/etc/davfs2.secrets is not
really an option since it would expose your password again, and in
plaintext at that.)


[ gksu ]

gksu interprets any output on stderr as an error. pam_mount writes
debug output to stderr, so this combination will only work if debugging
is disabled in pam_mount, or gksu gets fixed.


[ pam_mount < 0.19 - config file ]

Our config file format changed from plaintext to XML with version 0.19.
A Perl script to convert it can be found in the scripts/ directory
beginning with version 0.20.


[ ssh - password passing ]

When interactively asking for the password, the ssh client opens
/dev/tty and ignores stdin over which pam_mount passes the password.


[ sshd - various ]

When public key authentication is used, the PAM auth stage is entirely
skipped. Additionally, pam_mount is not able to ask for a password in
the session stage.

When "PrivilegeSeparation" is enabled, ssh will not run through the PAM
stacks.

"UsePAM" is required to make sshd go through the PAM stacks.

"UseLogin yes" may be used to enable pam_mount -- irrespective of
public key authentification, privilege separation or UsePAM=no. sshd
itself will not do anything useful w.r.t. pam_mount, but it will call
/bin/login which will then run through the PAM session stage, where
pam_mount can ask your for a password. Read the sshd documentation
about possible pitfalls involved using UseLogin.


[ su, probably others - privilege drop ]

I sometimes get reports about unmount failing because of insufficient
privileges. Some programs and/or distributions and/or pam
configurations seem to drop the root privileges after successful
authentification. This goes counter to pam_mount which needs these
privileges for umount. (May not apply for FUSE mounts.)

The following programs are confirmed to have this issue:

	* su/sux from coreutils

Unverified programs:

	* GDM on Ubuntu


[ vsftpd - not using PAM ]

vsftpd does not run through the PAM session code, hence will never
call pam_mount's mounting functions.
It also appears to drop privileges so that there would be a
unmounting problems.
