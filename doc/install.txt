	* pkg-config
	* Linux-PAM 0.99.x

	BSD PAM is untested and probably not working right now.

Additional required packages for building from (Git) snapshot:

	* autoconf 2.59 or up
	* automake 1.9 or up (automake 1.4 will NOT work)
	* libtool 1.5.22 or up (older ones might work)

	* cryptsetup 1.0.5 or up -- block-level encryption

	remote targets:
	* sshfs -- SFTP-over-SSH
	* ccgfs -- ccgfs-over-SSH (full operation support; mknod, acl, xattrs)
	* cifs-mount -- for CIFS and SMB shares

	configuration validation:
	* xmllint (libxml2)

DTD installation usage:

	Configure pam_mount with:
		--with-dtd

	To validate (assuming the installation prefix was /usr):
		xmllint --nonet --noout --loaddtd --valid
		--path /usr/share/xml/pam_mount/dtd/pam_mount.conf.xml.dtd
		/etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml
