This short document will explain the various pam_mount options.
Options are listed in the 4th column of a PAM file, e.g.:

	auth	optional	pam_mount.so	use_first_pass


<no argument>
	Always ask for password.

use_first_pass
	Always take the password from the PAM subsystem;
	if it is not available, fail the module. The error returned
	to the PAM core will be whatever error was encountered,
	e.g. Out of memory, etc.

try_first_pass
	Try taking the password from the PAM subsystem;
	if it fails, ask for password.

soft_try_pass
	Try taking the password from the PAM subsystem;
	if it fails, do not ask and return "Authentication token
	unavailable" instead. (Not quite the same as use_first_pass.)

nullok
	Do not fail if the authentication token was NULL (i.e. if
	the user was not asked by another PAM auth module to provide
	a password) and pam_mount was configured not to ask (e.g.
	with use_first_pass), and pam_mount.so is "required" in the
	PAM stack.
