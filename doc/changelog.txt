v0.29 (September 27 2007)

An uninitialized array and a copy-and-paste error were corrected in
the recently introduced process spawn code.

- [r353]: Explicitly initialize fd array (spawn.c)

- [r348]: Fix crash due to printf arguments in pmvarrun.c


v0.27 (September 26 2007)
=========================
This release fixes a crash on logout with su by using a fixed $PATH
to work around broken login programs. MSAD usernames are now accepted
in pmvarrun. The libglib dependency has been dropped.

- [r312]: add luserconf conversion note to convert_pam_mount_conf.pl
- [r313]: do not print "mount errors" if there won't be any

v0.26 (September 20 2007)
=========================
Luks argument ordering, mountpoint creation as user, and the
converter script were corrected. The "nullok" and --keyfile options
were added.

- [r293]: revert r290 which incorrectly changed the luks argument order
- [r294]: --keyfile option added to mount.crypt

  in converter script

v0.21 (September 17 2007)
=========================
 Some mount helpers needed a different option passing method.
Stacking of loop devices is now avoided, and pam_mount will not ask
for a password if no volumes are to be mounted. The documentation has
been updated to include PAM module stacking (e.g. when using pam_ldap
with pam_mount).

- [r264]: Silence unwanted error message (fallout from r240)
- [r270]: Add "Known Bugs and Issues" documentation
- [r274]: More documentation - How to stack PAM modules without pam_stack
- [r276]: Option passing to some mount helpers needs to be different
- [r277]: Avoid stacking of loop devices
- [r278]: Do not ask for password if no volumes found


v0.20 (September 05 2007)
=========================
This release adds extra options regarding pam_mount behavior
(messages and mount points).

- [r209]: Do not use absolute paths, search $PATH instead for programs
- [r210]: Add pam_mount.conf to .conf.xml converter
- [r223]: "sufficient" keyword documentation
- [r224]: Misc cryptmount fix
- [r232]: Pass down readonly flag to luksOpen
- [r237]: Add option to retain automatically created mountpoints
- [r240]: Create mountpoint as user if possible (e.g. if /home/USER
  already exists and your volume is /home/USER/myvol)
- [r249]: Build fixes, making it work OOTB again with FC6 and Autoconf 2.59
- [r251]: Allow changing the password prompt
- [r252]: Add an overview of pam_mount options (options.txt)
- [r253]: Implement the "soft_try_pass" option


v0.19 (July 04 2007)
====================
pam_mount now uses an XML config file, which also has a few new
variables and options. Support for truecrypt was added.

- [r126]: pam_mount switched to an XML configuration.
- [r160]: NT domain placeholders
- [r164]: properly detect loop64 support
