.TH mount.crypt 8 "2008\-10\-08" "pam_mount" "pam_mount"
.SH Name
mount.crypt - mount a dm\-crypt encrypted volume
.SH Syntax
\fBmount.crypt\fP [\fB-nr\fP] [\fB\-o\fP \fIoptions\fP]
\fIdevice\fP \fIdirectory\fP
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-o\fP \fIoptions\fP
Set the mount options. mount.crypt will take out its own options it recognizes
and passes any remaining options on to the underlying mount program.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP
Do not update /etc/mtab. Note that this makes it impossible to unmount the
volume by naming the container - you will have to pass the mountpoint to
umount.crypt.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
Set up the loop device (if necessary) and crypto device in read-only mode.
(The mount itself will necessarily also be read-only.) Note that doing a
remount using `mount /mnt -o remount,rw` will \fBnot\fP make the mount
readwrite. The crypto and loop devices will have to be disassociated first.
.SH Mount options
.TP
\fBdm\-wait\fP
Wait for udev to create /dev/mapper/\fIname\fP after calling cryptsetup(8).
.TP
\fBdm\-timeout=\fP\fIseconds\fP
Wait at most this many seconds before giving up. The default value is 5
seconds.
