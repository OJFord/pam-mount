	* Got rid of some compiler warnings.

	* Added some more error checking to openssl code.

	* In pam_mount.conf, if user is *, ~ will be expanded to user's
	home.

10 August 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Worked on documentation for encrypted filesystem keys.

	* (Following release 0.3.6) started using EVP_get_cipherbyname()
	-- should be real close to supporting all openssl-supported
	ciphers.

	* Added support for encrypted filesystem keys.

	* Pam_mount.spec now uses %config(noreplace) in install
	configuration.

03 August 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* (Following Release 0.3.5) began using FCTK.

	* Began to work on supporting filesystems that have a different
	password than the user's login password.

03 August 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Lsof now works when logging out of consoles.

	* Changed module type to session only.	THIS REQUIRES CHANGES
	TO PAM CONFIGURATION FILES (ie: /etc/pam.d/*).

	* Pmhelper now understands the mount point may not be in
	/etc/fstab.  In this case, the path is provided by pam_mount.so.

02 August 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Reduced the output of lsof to only files related to ~.

01 August 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Made /usr/sbin/lsof configurable in /etc/security/pam_mount.

30 July 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Changed syslog priorities.

	* Now logs output of /usr/sbin/lsof when debugging is on.

30 July 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Ran indent on source files.

	* Got rid of pmhelper.c.orig and pmhelper.c.rej.

30 June 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Fixed error that prevented encrypted volumes from working when
	debugging was off.

	* Updated CREDITS file.

27 June 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Fixed bug that caused segfault when unmounting with debugging
	on.

	* Location of config file is now /etc/security/pam_mount.conf
	by default.

	* UID of pmhelper process is now set to 0 since euid of 0 is
	not enough for using mount (makes u+s su work).

	* Mount point is now optional in pam_mount.conf for local mount
	type.  See pam_mount.conf example.  

	* Debug messages are now logged with syslog.

	* Cleaned up debug messages a bit.  Separated into log and
	debug messages.  Log messages are important and are printed even
	if debugging is off.

	* Got rid of some C++ style comments.

	* Applied Mukesh Agrawal's encryption patch.

17 December 2001 Elvis Pfützenreuter <epx@conectiva.com>

	* Removed broken test in pmhelper.c to see if monting directory
	is $HOME - now it will always wait for mount() to complete. If
	this poses problems, please notify (0.3.2).

29 November 2000 Elvis Pfützenreuter <epx@conectiva.com>

	* applied patch that waits mount to be completed if the mount
	point happens to be the user's home dir (see CREDITS) (0.3.1).
