	* Fixed error that prevented encrypted volumes from working when
	debugging was off.

	* Updated CREDITS file.

27 June 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Fixed bug that caused segfault when unmounting with debugging
	on.

	* Location of config file is now /etc/security/pam_mount.conf
	by default.

	* UID of pmhelper process is now set to 0 since euid of 0 is
	not enough for using mount (makes u+s su work).

	* Mount point is now optional in pam_mount.conf for local mount
	type.  See pam_mount.conf example.  

	* Debug messages are now logged with syslog.

	* Cleaned up debug messages a bit.  Separated into log and
	debug messages.  Log messages are important and are printed even
	if debugging is off.

	* Got rid of some C++ style comments.

	* Applied Mukesh Agrawal's encryption patch.

			mount point happens to be the user's home dir (see CREDITS)

			directory is $HOME - now it will always wait for mount()
