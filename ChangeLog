30 June 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Fixed error that prevented encrypted volumes from working when
	debugging was off.

	* Updated CREDITS file.

27 June 2002 W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>

	* Fixed bug that caused segfault when unmounting with debugging
	on.

	* Location of config file is now /etc/security/pam_mount.conf
	by default.

	* UID of pmhelper process is now set to 0 since euid of 0 is
	not enough for using mount (makes u+s su work).

	* Mount point is now optional in pam_mount.conf for local mount
	type.  See pam_mount.conf example.  

	* Debug messages are now logged with syslog.

	* Cleaned up debug messages a bit.  Separated into log and
	debug messages.  Log messages are important and are printed even
	if debugging is off.

	* Got rid of some C++ style comments.

	* Applied Mukesh Agrawal's encryption patch.

17 December 2001 Elvis Pfützenreuter <epx@conectiva.com>

	* Removed broken test in pmhelper.c to see if monting directory
	is $HOME - now it will always wait for mount() to complete. If
	this poses problems, please notify (0.3.2).

29 November 2000 Elvis Pfützenreuter <epx@conectiva.com>

	* applied patch that waits mount to be completed if the mount
	point happens to be the user's home dir (see CREDITS) (0.3.1).
