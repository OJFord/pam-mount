# Individual users may define additional volumes to mount if allowed
# by pam_mount.conf (usually ~/.pam_mount.conf).  The volume keyword is
# the only valid keyword in these per-user configuration files.  If the
# luserconf parameter is set in pam_mount.conf, allowing user-defined
# volume, then users may mount and unmount any volume they own at any
# mount point they own.  On some filesystem configurations this may be
# a security flaw so user-defined volumes are not allowed by the example
# pam_mount.conf distributed with pam_mount.
#
# Format: luserconf <file>
# luserconf .pam_mount.conf

# These directives determine which options may be specified in a user config
# file (luserconf). You must include one of these directives if you have a
# luserconf directive. You may not include both directives.
#
# If you have an options_allow directive, then the options listed in that
# directive wil be allowed, and all others rejected. If you have an
# options_deny directive, then the options listed will be denied, and all others
# permitted.
#
# You may use the wildcard '*' to match all options.

# I recommend not permitting the suid and dev options.

# The options listed in this directive are required for all volumes from a
# user config file. That is, any volume specified in a user config file that
# does not include these options will be ignored.
#
# Note: you must make sure that a required option is permitted (either by
# including it in options_allow, or by not including it in options_deny).
#
# I recommend requiring at least nosuid and nodev.

# This is ignored completely if the volume is configured to get its options

# Volumes that will be mounted when user triggers pam_mount module

# Format:
# volume <user> [smb|ncp|nfs|local] <server> <volume> <mount point> <mount options> <fs key cipher> <fs key path>
#
# Note that if the mount command has specified an option, eg %(KEYBITS)
# and you don't specify a value, a warning is printed in the log. The

# General examples:
# volume user smb krueger public /home/user/krueger - - -
# volume user ncp krueger public /home/user/krueger user=user.context - -


# crypt mounts require a kernel with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM and CONFIG_DM_CRYPT
# enabled as well as all the used ciphers (eg. CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_586,
# CONFIG_CRYPTO_TWOFISH, etc.)
#
# Linux encrypted home directory examples, using dm_crypt:
# volume user crypt - /dev/sda2 /home/user cipher=aes aes-256-ecb /home/user.key


# cryptoloop mounts require a kernel with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP enabled.
# Linux encrypted home directory examples, using cryptoloop:
#
# volume user local - /dev/hda123 /home/user loop,encryption=aes - -
# volume user local - /home/user.img /home/user loop,user,exec,encryption=aes,keybits=256 - -
# volume user local - /home/user.img - - - -
# volume user local - /home/user.img - - aes-256-ecb /home/user4.key

# The last two examples (^^) need a line like the following in
# /etc/fstab:
#   /home/user4.img /home/user4 xfs user,loop,encryption=aes,keybits=256,noauto 0 0


# OpenBSD encrypted home directory example (see also lclmount above):
# volume user local - /home/user.img /home/user svnd0 - -


# Volatile tmpfs mount with restricted size
# (thanks to Mike Hommey for this example)
# volume test local - /tmpfs/test /home/test "size=10M,uid=test,gid=users,mode=0700 -t tmpfs" - -


# Details:
# Local user configuration (~/.pam_mount.conf) can extend this.
#
# If there are no servers, mount options, fs key ciphers, etc. you must
# supply a lone dash, i.e. "-"
#
# See http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Loopback-Encrypted-Filesystem-HOWTO.html
# to learn how to create a encrypted loopback filesystem.
#
# If the volume's password is different than the user's login password,
# the following technique may be used (see also README):
#
# {...} are placeholders, insert the proper value there!
#
# 1.  Create a file containing the volume's password (FS key).  If you are
#     using pam_mount to mount an loopback encrypted volume, this password
#     should may generated by /dev/urandom.  
#
#     Simple example: 
#     echo {volume password} | openssl enc aes-256-ecb >/home/user.key
#     Encrypt this file using the user's login password as the key.
#
#     Verbose loopback encrypted volume example:
#     a.  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/user.img bs=1M count={image size in MB}
#     b.  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1c count={keysize/8} | \
#         openssl enc -{fs key cipher} >/home/user.key
#         Encrypt this file using the user's login password as the key.
#     c.  modprobe cryptoloop
#     d.  openssl enc -d -{fs key cipher} -in /home/user.key | \
#         losetup -e aes -k <keysize> -p0 /dev/loop0 /home/user.img
#     e.  mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0
#     f.  losetup -d /dev/loop0
#
# 3.  In pam_mount.conf:
#	a.  Set the fs key cipher variable to the cipher used (ie: aes-256-ecb).
#	b.  Set the fs key path variable to the key's path (ie: /home/user.key)
# 4.  If a user changes his login password, regenerate the efsk that 
#     was created in step 1b.  A script named passwdehd is provided to do this.
#
# If fs_key_cipher is -, then the user's login password is also the volume's 
# password.

# Template (or wildcard) volumes
#
# If user is "*", "&" will be replaced by name of the user logging on in the
# volume, mount point, mount options and fs key path fields.  "~/*" will be
# replaced with "<user's homedir>/*."
#
# volume * smb krueger &     /home/&         uid=&,gid=&,dmask=0750 - -
# volume * smb krueger homes /home/&/remote  - - -
# volume * local - /home/&.img - - aes-256-ecb /etc/ehd/&

# Windows 2000, which requires a domain specified, example (thanks John Knox):
# volume * smb viper & /home/& uid=&,gid=&,dmask=0750,workgroup=WINDOWS_DOMAIN - -

# An NCP example:
# volume user ncp SERVER /USERS/Department/user /home/user user=user.full.context,uid=user,gid=user,symlinks - -

# An example using spaces:
# volume * smb krueger 'Home\ Directories' /home/& - - -
