Note: you must include either options_allow or options_deny to use this

Individual users may define additional volumes to mount if allowed by
pam_mount.conf.xml (usually ~/.pam_mount.conf.xml). The volume keyword is the
only valid keyword in these per-user configuration files. If the
luserconf parameter is set in pam_mount.conf.xml, allowing user-defined
volumes, users may mount and unmount any volumes they specify. The mount
operation is executed under the user account, not with root permissions.

<!--
These directives determine which options may be specified in a user
config file (luserconf). You must include one of these directives if you
have a luserconf directive. You may not include both directives.

If you have an options_allow directive, then the options listed in that
directive wil be allowed, and all others rejected. If you have an
options_deny directive, then the options listed will be denied, and all
others permitted.

You may use the wildcard '*' to match all options. I recommend not
permitting the suid and dev options.

<mntoptions deny="suid,dev" />

<!--
The options listed in this directive are required for all volumes from a
user config file. That is, any volume specified in a user config file
that does not include these options will be ignored.

Note: you must make sure that a required option is permitted (either by
including it in options_allow, or by not including it in options_deny).

I recommend requiring at least nosuid and nodev.

This is ignored completely if the volume is configured to get its
options and mount point from /etc/fstab.

Volumes that will be mounted when user triggers the pam_mount module
(usually at login).

    <volume
        user="*"
        fstype="auto"
        server="..."
        path="..."
        mountpoint="..."
        options="..."
        fskeycipher="..."
        fskeypath="..."
    />

USER is a user for which a volume rule applies. "*" selects all users,
"@xyz" selects all users who have xyz as their primary group, and
"@@xyz" selects all users who either have xyz as their primary or
secondary group. If this attribute is not present, "*" is assumed.


FSTYPE can be any filesystem type. If /bin/mount or the kernel does not
support it, you will get an error. You can use the special keyword
"auto" which automatically lets the kernel choose a matching filesystem.
Note that you the kernel's auto feature only works with filesystems
listed in /proc/filesystem, so you will have to load the necessary
modules _first_ for them to be recognized with "auto". If this attribute
is not present, "auto" is assumed.

The "cifs", "smbfs" and "ncpfs" types override the identically-named kernel
filesystems and use the smbmount/ncpmount programs, as defined above,
instead of `mount -t smbfs ...`.


SERVER defines the server from which to source. The exact volume path depends
on the filesystem type (SMB uses //SERVER/VOLUME, NFS uses SERVER:VOLUME).
The attribute may be absent.


PATH specifies the source location of the volume on the server (if applies).
This attribute is mandatory.


MOUNTPOINT specifies the destination folder onto which the volume is mounted.
'~' expands to the user's home directory as present in the passwd database,
according to sh semantics. "~name" is not supported. If this attribute is
omitted, the location is read from /etc/fstab, which also requires PATH to be
the device of an fstab entry.


OPTIONS specifies mount options. If omitted, and /etc/fstab is used (see
MOUNTPOINT), then the options are also sourced from fstab.


Note that if the mount command has specified an option, e.g. %(KEYBITS)
and you do not specify a value, a warning is printed in the log. The
warning can usually be ignored, except when the option is mandatory.

SMB mounts require the `smbmount` and `smbumount` programs,
NCP `ncpmount` and `ncpumount`. Both SMB and NCP work in ~/.pam_mount.conf.xml.


General examples:

    <volume user="user" fstype="smbfs" server="krueger" path="public"
        mountpoint="/home/user/krueger" />

    <volume user="user" fstype="ncpfs" server="krueger" path="public"
        mountpoint="/home/user/krueger" options="user=user.context" />

    <volume fstype="smbfs" server="krueger" path="homes"
        mountpoint="/home/%(USER)/remote" options="dmask=0711" />

You can use ~ to use whatever home directory the user has (therefore you can
distribute home directories along more than one location.
This is useful for pam_chroot:

    <volume path="/bin" mountpoint="~/bin" options="bind" />

For FUSE mounts, use something like this:

    <volume ftype="fuse" path="sshfs#%(USER)@fileserver:"
        mountpoint="~" />

    <volume fstype="nfs" server="fileserver" path="/home/%(USER)"
        mountpoint="~" />

Some more examples:

    <volume path="/home/%(USER).img" mountpoint="~" fskeycipher="aes-256-ecb"
        fskeypath="/etc/ehd/%(USER)" />

Windows 2000, which requires a domain specified (does it really? works for
me without -jengelh), example (thanks John Knox):

    <volume fstype="smbfs" server="viper" path="%(USER)"
        mountpoint="~" options="dmask=0751,workgroup=WINDOWS_DOMAIN" />

Linux encrypted home directory examples, using dm_crypt:

crypt mounts require a kernel with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM and CONFIG_DM_CRYPT
enabled as well as all the used ciphers (e.g. CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_586,
CONFIG_CRYPTO_TWOFISH, etc.). crypt mounts must be in the global config
file /etc/security/pam_mount.conf

Linux encrypted home directory examples, using dm_crypt:

    <volume fstype="crypt" path="/dev/sda2" mountpoint="/home/user"
        options="cipher=aes" fskeycipher="aes-256-ecb"
        fskeypath="/home/user.key" />

cryptoloop mounts require a kernel with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP enabled.
cryptoloop mounts must be in the global config /etc/security/pam_mount.conf
Linux encrypted home directory examples, using cryptoloop:

    <volume path="/dev/hda123" mountpoint="/home/user"
        options="loop,encryption=aes" />

    <volume path="/home/user.img" mountpoint="/home/user"
        options="loop,user,exec,encryption=aes,keybits=256" />

    <volume path="/home/user.img" />

    <volume path="/home/user.img" fskeycipher="aes-256-ecb"
        fskeypath="/home/user4.key" />

The last two examples (^^) need a line like the following in /etc/fstab:

    /home/user4.img /home/user4 xfs user,loop,encryption=aes,keybits=256,noauto 0 0

OpenBSD encrypted home directory example (see also lclmount above):

    <volume path="/home/user.img" mountpoint="/home/user"
        options="svnd0" />

Volatile tmpfs mount with restricted size (thanks to Mike Hommey for
this example):

    <volume user="test" fstype="tmpfs" path="none" mountpoint="/home/test"
        options="size=10M,uid=test,gid=users,mode=0700" />

See http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Loopback-Encrypted-Filesystem-HOWTO.html
to learn how to create a encrypted loopback filesystem.

If the volume's password is different than the user's login password,
the following technique may be used (see also README):

{...} are placeholders, insert the proper value there!

1.  Create a file containing the volume's password (FS key). If you are
    using pam_mount to mount an loopback encrypted volume, this password
    should be generated with /dev/urandom.

    Simple example:
    echo {volume password} | openssl enc -aes-256-ecb >/home/user.key
    Encrypt this file using the user's login password as the key.

    Verbose loopback encrypted volume example:
    a.  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/user.img bs=1M count={image size in MB}
    b.  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1c count={keysize/8} | \
        openssl enc -{fs key cipher} >/home/user.key
        Encrypt this file using the user's login password as the key.
    c.  modprobe -q cryptoloop
    d.  openssl enc -d -{fs key cipher} -in /home/user.key | \
        losetup -e aes -k {keysize} -p0 /dev/loop0 /home/user.img
    e.  mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0
    f.  losetup -d /dev/loop0

3.  In pam_mount.conf:
        a.  Set the fs key cipher variable to the cipher used
            (ie: aes-256-ecb).
        b.  Set the fs key path variable to the key's path
            (ie: /home/user.key)

4.  If a user changes his login password, regenerate the efsk that
    was created in step 1b.  A script named passwdehd is provided to
    do this.

If FSKEYCIPHER is empty, then the user's login password is also the
volume's password.
