Description: a PAM module that can mount volumes for a user session
 This module is aimed at environments with SMB (Samba or Windows NT) 
 or NCP (Netware or Mars-NWE) servers that Unix users wish to access 
 transparently. It facilitates access to private volumes of these types 
 well. The module also supports mounting home directories using 
 loopback encrypted filesystems. The module was originally written for 
 use on the Linux operating system but has since been modified to 
 work on several flavors of BSD.

 o Every user can access his own volumes

 o The user needs to type the password just once (at login)

 o The mounting process is transparent to the users

 o There is no need to keep the login passwords in any additional file

 o The volumes are unmounted upon logout, so it saves system resources, 
 avoiding the need of listing every every possibly useful remote 
 volume in /etc/fstab or in an automount/supermount config file. This 
 is also necessary for securing encrypted filesystems.

 Pam_mount "understands" SMB, NCP, and any type of filesystem that can 
 be mounted using the standard mount command. If someone has a 
 particular need for a different filesystem, feel free to ask me to 
 include it and send me patches.
