As of version 3.3, sshd has a feature called privelege seperation that
is incompatible with PAM modules needing root privileges.

If you wish to use sshd with pam_mount either turn of privelege seperation
in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (UsePrivilegeSeparation no) or ensure that
pam_mount can operate without root privileges.  Specifying volumes using
/etc/fstab and allowing users to mount and unmount them using the user
option may help pam_mount to perform without root privileges:

# /etc/security/pam_mount.conf:
volume user local - /home/user.img - - - -

# /etc/fstab:
/home/user4.img /home/user4 ext2 user,loop,encryption=aes,keybits=256,noauto 0 0

Please let me know if you have a better idea allowing pam_mount to work
with privilege separation.
